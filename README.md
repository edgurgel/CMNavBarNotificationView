CMNavBarNotificationView
==================

An in-app notification view above the navigation bar "TOTALLY" based on [MPNotificationView](https://github.com/Moped/MPNotificationView). Compatible with iOS 4.3 and above.

###Features:

- Animation and layout similar to iOS 6 notifications
- Provides two `UILabels` and an `UIImageView`
- Simple API
- Enqueues multiple notifications and shows them with a default duration of 2 seconds.

###Usage:

Simply use the following call to show a message and related detail text:

````
    [CMNavBarNotificationView notifyWithText:@"Grumpy wizards" andDetail:@"make a toxic brew"];`
````

Or use the following call to add a thumbnail image and customize duration:

````
    [CMNavBarNotificationView notifyWithText:@"Moped Dog:"
                                detail:@"I have no idea what I'm doing..."
                                 image:[UIImage imageNamed:@"mopedDog.jpeg"]
                           andDuration:5.0];
````

Or if you need to load the image async using `AFNetworking`:

````
    CMNavBarNotificationView* notification =
    [CMNavBarNotificationView notifyWithText:@"Moped Dog:"
                                detail:@"I have no idea what I'm doing..."
                                 image:nil
                           andDuration:5.0];

    //From UIImage+AFNetworking.h:
    [notification.imageView setImageWithURL:[NSURL URLWithString:@"https://dl.dropbox.com/u/361895/mopeddog.png"]];

````

If you would like to set a background image:

````
	[CMNavBarNotificationView setBackgroundImage:[UIImage imageNamed:@"aImage"]];
    [CMNavBarNotificationView notifyWithText:@"Moped Dog:"
                                detail:@"I have no idea what I'm doing..."
                                 image:nil
                           andDuration:5.0];


````

Touch handling can be implemented using blocks:

````
    [CMNavBarNotificationView notifyWithText:@"Grumpy wizards"
                                detail:@"make a toxic brew for the jovial queen"
                         andTouchBlock:^(CMNavBarNotificationView *notificationView) {
                             NSLog( @"Received touch for notification with text: %@", notificationView.textLabel.text );
    }];
````

Also by specifying a delegate which implements the `CMNavBarNotificationViewDelegate` and finally by handling the `kCMNavBarNotificationViewTapReceivedNotification` notification.
